##  Executive Summary

This project transforms raw Twitter trend and tweet data into a dynamic, interactive Streamlit dashboard. The core analysis focuses on a specific viral trend, **\#WeLoveTheEarth**, comparing its global and local popularity while deeply investigating the engagement and reach generated by key celebrity accounts.

The project highlights three key areas of insight:

1. **Trend Overlap:** Quantifying the intersection between WorldWide (WW) and United States (US) trending topics.  
2. **Influencer Impact:** Analyzing celebrity engagement rates to find that **Lil Dicky** generated the highest *normalized engagement* (engagement relative to follower count), demonstrating the power of topic relevance over sheer follower size.  
3. **Global Reach:** Visualizing the language distribution of tweets using an interactive map, confirming the trend's international reach.

This work serves as a portfolio piece showcasing end-to-end data analysis, cleaning, visualization, and deployment skills.

##  Business Problem

In a near real-time social media environment, businesses and marketing strategists need to quickly:

1. **Identify Relevant Topics:** Distinguish between transient local buzz and robust global thought waves.  
2. **Evaluate Influencer ROI:** Move beyond follower counts to calculate true engagement and effectiveness of celebrity endorsements.  
3. **Gauge Market Penetration:** Understand the demographic/geographic spread of a campaign based on tweet language.

The goal of this project is to provide a tool that delivers these actionable insights interactively, unlike traditional static reports.

## Methodology

The project was executed in two phases:

### **Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Exploratory Analysis (Jupyter Notebook)**

* **Data Source:** JSON snapshots simulating responses from the Twitter API's /trends/place and /search/tweets endpoints.  
* **WW/US Comparison (Steps 1-3):** Loaded global (WWTrends.json) and local (USTrends.json) trends, using Python's set.intersection() method to programmatically identify common topics.  
* **Tweet Deep Dive (Steps 4-7):** Focused on the common and highly popular \#WeLoveTheEarth trend (WeLoveTheEarth.json). Extracted key entities (text, user mentions, hashtags) and performed simple **frequency analysis** (collections.Counter) to confirm the trend's context (a music video involving Lil Dicky and environmentalists like DiCaprio).  
* **Data Aggregation (Steps 7-8):** Created a comprehensive Pandas DataFrame containing Retweets, Favorites, Followers, and **calculated a key custom metric: Normalized Engagement Rate**.

### **Phase 2: Interactive Dashboard Development (Streamlit)**

* **Data Integration:** Refactored Phase 1 logic into a single Python script (twitter\_dashboard.py) using the @st.cache\_data decorator for optimized performance.  
* **Visualization:** Utilized **Plotly Express** to create interactive visualizations:  
  * **Venn Diagram:** Displayed the relationship between WW and US trends using matplotlib-venn.  
  * **Bubble Scatter Plot:** Visualized Retweets vs. Favorites, using Followers as bubble size (log scales applied for better distribution viewing).  
  * **Normalized Engagement Bar Chart:** Presented the calculated engagement rate metric, providing a fair comparison of influencer effectiveness.  
  * **Choropleth Map:** Used the tweet language codes (lang) to create a global map visualization of the trend's geographic reach.

## **Skills Demonstrated**

* **Python Programming:** Modular code development, custom functions, list comprehensions, and error handling.  
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas DataFrames, custom metric calculation (Normalized Engagement Rate), data aggregation (groupby, agg).  
* **Data Visualization:** Mastery of **Plotly Express** for generating interactive, production-ready charts (scatter plots, bar charts, choropleth maps).  
* **Web Frameworks:** Building and deploying an interactive dashboard using **Streamlit**.  
* **Statistical Concepts:** Frequency distribution analysis, calculating normalized metrics for fair comparison.  
* **Version Control:** Project structured for GitHub, including requirements.txt and README.md.

## ** Results and Business Recommendation**

| Influencer (Screen Name) | Followers | Normalized Engagement Rate | Key Insight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Lil Dicky** | \~2.5M | **\~42.4%** | Highest **relative** success due to topic ownership and relevance. |
| Leonardo DiCaprio | \~18.5M | \~2.19% | High absolute engagement, but lower relative rate. |
| Katy Perry | \~107M | \~0.0098% | Huge follower count, minimal relative impact on this specific topic. |

**Key Business Recommendation:**

Marketing campaigns should prioritize influencers whose public image and content **align directly with the campaign's topic** (e.g., Lil Dicky being the creator of the Earth video) over those who merely possess the highest follower counts (e.g., Katy Perry). The Normalized Engagement Rate provides a quantitative, data-driven measure of campaign alignment and true influence.

## ** Next Steps (Future Enhancements)**

The following steps could further enhance this project for production readiness:

* **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrate the NLTK VADER or Hugging Face models to analyze the sentiment of the tweets and categorize positive/negative reactions.  
* **Time-Series Analysis:** If a larger, time-stamped dataset were available, track engagement and sentiment *over time* to identify the peak influence hours.  
* **Search Integration:** Add a feature in Streamlit that allows the user to input a custom hashtag to analyze new data in real-time (requires a live API key).  
* **Topic Modeling:** Apply LDA or NMF to the tweet text to discover secondary, hidden themes being discussed beyond the explicit hashtags.
